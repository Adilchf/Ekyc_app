Designed and built a user-friendly interface in Flutter, while handling backend logic in FastAPI with PostgreSQL for secure data storage. Focused on real-time image processing, usability, and security to ensure a smooth and compliant verification process. Gained hands-on experience in computer vision, mobile development, backend integration, and biometric identity validation.
